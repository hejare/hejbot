Role: Introduced "Bubble" Organizational Structure to Scale Participation and Culture
Company: Hejare
Time period: Q1 2024 – Q2 2024
Keywords: Organizational Design, Change Management, Distributed Leadership, Workshop Design, Teal Practices, Scaling Organizations, Continious Improvement, Team Facilitation
At Hejare, a growing consultancy with a flat structure, Carl-Oscar introduced a new organizational model to strengthen engagement and decision-making as the company expanded. Observing that the monthly all-hands meetings had become less impactful and that only a fraction of voices were heard, he designed and implemented “bubbles” — small groups of 7–9 people, inspired by Teal and anti-fragile organizational principles.
Carl-Oscar formed the groups, set clear expectations, created workshop material, and facilitated the initial rollout. He also checked in with the bubbles to gather feedback and continuously refine the model. The approach proved highly successful, with more than 90% of employees preferring the new structure.
Strategically, the bubble model enabled Hejare to scale while maintaining the sense of a smaller, connected company where everyone could contribute ideas, check in on each other’s well-being, and feel empowered to drive change. This reorganization increased work satisfaction, deepened consultants’ sense of impact, and built a more resilient culture.
